## Creating Your Own Outdoor HIIT Workouts

Follow these principles to design effective outdoor interval sessions:

### 1. Scout Your Location First

* Identify natural features you can incorporate (hills, steps, clearings, etc.)
* Note potential hazards to avoid (slippery surfaces, thorny plants, etc.)
* Plan your workout area to minimize disruption to others
* Check weather conditions and adjust accordingly

### 2. Structure Your Intervals

* **Time-based:** Set work and rest periods (e.g., 40 seconds work, 20 seconds rest)
* **Distance-based:** Use natural markers (e.g., sprint between trees, recover on the walk back)
* **Landmark-based:** Work until you reach a specific point, then recover until the next marker
* **Mixed approach:** Combine the above methods for variety

### 3. Choose Appropriate Exercises

**Cardiovascular-focused movements:**
* Sprints on various terrains
* Hill repeats
* Stair climbing
* Beach runs
* Agility patterns around natural obstacles

**Bodyweight strength exercises:**
* Push-ups on elevated surfaces (rocks, logs, benches)
* Natural pull-ups on sturdy tree branches
* Box jumps onto stable rocks or logs
* Tricep dips on park benches
* Step-ups on natural elevations

### 4. Plan for Safety

* Bring sufficient water
* Apply sunscreen
* Wear appropriate footwear for the terrain
* Tell someone your workout location if in remote areas
* Carry a fully charged phone
