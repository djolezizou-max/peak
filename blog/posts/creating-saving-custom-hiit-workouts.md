# Creating and Saving Custom HIIT Workouts in Peak Interval

High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is most effective when tailored to your specific fitness goals, abilities, and preferences. While pre-designed workouts are great starting points, creating custom workouts allows you to take control of your fitness journey. The Peak Interval app makes this process simple and intuitive, letting you design, save, and access personalized HIIT routines with just a few taps.

## Why Create Custom HIIT Workouts?

Before diving into the how-to, let's explore why custom workouts are worth your time:

- **Personalized Intensity**: Adjust work and rest periods based on your current fitness level
- **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase difficulty as you get stronger
- **Targeted Training**: Focus on specific fitness goals like endurance, power, or fat loss
- **Equipment Adaptation**: Design workouts around the equipment you have available
- **Time Optimization**: Create routines that fit your schedule, whether it's 10 minutes or 45
- **Injury Accommodation**: Work around limitations or injuries with modified intervals

## Getting Started: The Basics of Custom Workout Creation

Creating your first custom workout in Peak Interval is straightforward. Here's how to get started:

1. Open the Peak Interval app on your device
2. Navigate to the "Workouts" tab
3. Tap the "+" or "Create New" button
4. Select "Custom Workout" from the options

Now you're ready to start designing your personalized HIIT session!

## Customizing Your Workout Structure

Peak Interval gives you complete control over your workout structure. Here are the key elements you can customize:

### 1. Workout Name and Description

First, give your workout a name that's easy to remember, like "Tuesday Power HIIT" or "Quick Morning Burner." You can also add a description to remind yourself of the workout's focus or required equipment.

### 2. Interval Setup

This is where the real customization happens:

- **Work Intervals**: Set the duration of your high-intensity periods (from 10 seconds to several minutes)
- **Rest Intervals**: Determine how long you'll recover between work periods
- **Rounds/Cycles**: Choose how many times to repeat your interval pattern
- **Preparation Time**: Add a countdown before your workout begins
- **Cool Down Period**: Set time for a proper cool-down at the end

### 3. Advanced Interval Patterns

Peak Interval supports more complex interval structures:

- **Pyramid Intervals**: Gradually increase then decrease interval durations
- **Tabata Sets**: Classic 20/10 intervals with set rest periods between rounds
- **EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute)**: Start a new exercise at the top of each minute
- **AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)**: Complete as many rounds as possible in a set time

## Saving and Organizing Your Custom Workouts

Once you've designed your perfect workout, you'll want to save it for future use:

1. Tap the "Save" button at the bottom of the workout creation screen
2. Choose a category for your workout (optional but helpful for organization)
3. Add tags to make it easily searchable (e.g., "quick," "lower body," "no equipment")

Peak Interval allows you to organize your saved workouts in several ways:

- **Folders**: Create folders like "Morning Workouts" or "Travel Routines"
- **Favorites**: Mark your go-to workouts for quick access
- **Recent**: Quickly access recently used workouts
- **Calendar Integration**: Schedule workouts for specific days

## Advanced Features for Custom Workouts

Take advantage of these powerful features to enhance your custom HIIT workouts:

### Sound Customization

Personalize the audio experience of your workout:

- Choose different sounds for work start/end and rest start/end
- Adjust volume levels for different cues
- Enable or disable voice countdown
- Add motivational prompts at specific intervals

### Visual Customization

Make your timer exactly how you want it:

- Select color schemes for work and rest periods
- Choose digital or analog timer display
- Enable/disable progress bars and round counters
- Customize text size for better visibility during workouts

### Exercise Assignment

For comprehensive workout guidance:

- Assign specific exercises to each interval
- Add exercise descriptions and form notes
- Include images or GIFs demonstrating proper technique
- Set up automatic exercise rotation for circuit-style workouts

## Creating Workout Programs with Custom Routines

Take your training to the next level by creating multi-day programs:

1. Design several complementary custom workouts
2. Organize them into a program sequence
3. Schedule rest days between workout days
4. Track progress across the entire program

This approach helps ensure balanced training and proper recovery while keeping your workouts fresh and engaging.

## Tips for Effective Custom Workouts

Make the most of your custom HIIT routines with these expert tips:

### Balance Intensity and Recovery
Finding the right work-to-rest ratio is crucial for effective HIIT. Beginners might start with a 1:2 ratio (e.g., 30 seconds work, 60 seconds rest), while more advanced athletes might use a 2:1 ratio (e.g., 40 seconds work, 20 seconds rest).

### Progressive Programming
Create several versions of the same workout with gradually increasing intensity. For example:
- Week 1: 30/30 work/rest ratio
- Week 2: 35/25 work/rest ratio
- Week 3: 40/20 work/rest ratio

### Consider Your Goals
Design your intervals based on what you want to achieve:
- **Fat loss**: Moderate intervals with minimal rest (30/15 or 40/20)
- **Cardiovascular endurance**: Longer intervals (60-90 seconds) with equal rest
- **Power development**: Short, all-out intervals (10-20 seconds) with longer rest (40-60 seconds)

### Mix Modalities
Create workouts that combine different types of exercises:
- Cardio + strength
- Upper body + lower body
- Push + pull movements

## Troubleshooting Custom Workouts

If you encounter issues with your custom workouts, try these solutions:

- **Workout not saving**: Make sure you've filled in all required fields and have sufficient storage space
- **Timer not working properly**: Close and restart the app, or check for app updates
- **Sound cues not playing**: Check your device volume and notification settings
- **Syncing issues**: Ensure you're signed into your account and have internet connectivity
