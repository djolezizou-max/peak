# Gemini Capability Note (Added 2025-05-06):
# Gemini can successfully propose terminal commands (like curl for downloads, mv for moves)
# which, upon user approval, will execute in the user's terminal environment.
# This allows for searching, downloading, and moving files within the workspace,
# provided the necessary commands are approved by the user.
